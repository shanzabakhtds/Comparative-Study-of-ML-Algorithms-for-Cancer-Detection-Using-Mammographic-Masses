# Comparative-Study-of-ML-Algorithms-for-Cancer-Detection-Using-Mammographic-Masses
Led a comprehensive project to evaluate and compare various machine learning techniques for the effective detection of breast cancer through the analysis of mammographic masses


DESCRIPTION:

•	Conducted in-depth analysis using the Mammographic Mass Data Set from UCI ML Repository. Aimed to predict benign/malignant status based on BI-RADS attributes and age.

•	Implemented a variety of machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to assess their efficacy in breast cancer detection.

•	Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to preprocess and clean the dataset, ensuring its suitability for machine learning model training.

•	Applied rigorous feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive performance of the models, optimizing for both sensitivity and specificity in cancer detection.

•	Conducted in-depth model evaluation and comparison, employing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to quantify the performance of each algorithm in breast cancer prediction.

•	Presented findings and insights to stakeholders in a clear and accessible manner, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each machine learning technique in the context of breast cancer detection.
